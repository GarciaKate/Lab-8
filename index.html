								<h4>A little bit of Blake's background...</h4>
								<br>
								<h2>William Blake was born in London on November 28, 1757,  to James,  a hosier, and Catherine Blake.<br>
								Two of his six siblings died in infancy. From early childhood, Blake spoke of having visions—at four <br>
								he saw God “put his head to the window”;  around age nine, while walking through the countryside, he <br>
								saw a tree filled with angels.  Although his parents tried to discourage him from “lying,"  they did <br>
								observe that he  was different from  his peers and did  not force him to attend  conventional school.<br>
								He learned to read and write at home. At age ten, Blake expressed a wish to become a painter, so his <br>
								parents  sent him to  drawing school.  Two years later,  Blake began writing poetry.  When he turned <br>
								fourteen,  he apprenticed  with an  engraver  because  art school proved  too costly. One of Blake’s <br>
								assignments as apprentice was to sketch the tombs at Westminster Abbey, exposing him to a variety of <br>
								Gothic styles from which he would draw inspiration  throughout his career. After his seven-year term <br>
								ended,he studied briefly at the Royal Academy.<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								In 1782,  he married an  illiterate woman  named Catherine Boucher.  Blake taught her to read and to <br>
								write, and also instructed her in draftsmanship.  Later, she helped him print the illuminated poetry <br>
								for which he is remembered today;  the couple had no children.  In 1784 he set up a printshop with a <br>
								friend and former fellow apprentice, James Parker, but this  venture failed after several years. For <br>
								the remainder of his life, Blake made a  meager living as  an engraver and illustrator for books and <br>
								magazines. In addition to his wife,  Blake also began training his younger brother Robert in drawing,<br>
								painting,  and engraving. Robert  fell ill during  the winter  of 1787  and  succumbed,  probably to <br>
								consumption. As Robert died, Blake saw his brother’s spirit  rise up through  the ceiling, “clapping <br>
								its hands for joy.” He believed  that Robert’s  spirit continued to visit him and later claimed that <br>
								in a dream Robert taught him the printing method that he used in Songs of Innocence and other “illuminated” <br>
								works.<br>

								<h3>Auguries Of Innocence<br>
							
								<h4> To see a World in a Grain of Sand<br>
									And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,<br>
									Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand<br>
									And Eternity in an hour. <br>
									<br>
									A Robin Red breast in a Cage<br>
									Puts all Heaven in a Rage.<br>
									A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons<br>
									Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.<br>
									A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate<br>
									Predicts the ruin of the State.<br>
									A Horse misus'd upon the Road<br>
									Calls to Heaven for Human blood.<br>
									Each outcry of the hunted Hare<br>
									A fibre from the Brain does tear.<br>
									A Skylark wounded in the wing,<br>
									A Cherubim does cease to sing.<br>
									The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight<br>
									Does the Rising Sun affright.<br>
									Every Wolf's & Lion's howl<br>
									Raises from Hell a Human Soul.<br>
									The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,<br>
									Keeps the Human Soul from Care.<br>
									The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife<br>
									And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.<br>
									The Bat that flits at close of Eve<br>
									Has left the Brain that won't believe.<br>
									The Owl that calls upon the Night<br>
									Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.<br>
									He who shall hurt the little Wren<br>
									Shall never be belov'd by Men.<br>
									He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd<br>
									Shall never be by Woman lov'd.<br>
									The wanton Boy that kills the Fly<br>
									Shall feel the Spider's enmity.<br>
									He who torments the Chafer's sprite<br>
									Weaves a Bower in endless Night.<br>
									The Catterpillar on the Leaf<br>
									Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.<br>
									Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,<br>
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.<br>
He who shall train the Horse to War<br>
Shall never pass the Polar Bar.<br>
The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,<br>
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.<br>
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song<br>
Poison gets from Slander's tongue.<br>
The poison of the Snake & Newt<br>
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.<br>
The poison of the Honey Bee<br>
Is the Artist's Jealousy.<br>
The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags<br>
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.<br>
A truth that's told with bad intent<br>
Beats all the Lies you can invent.<br>
It is right it should be so;<br>
Man was made for Joy & Woe;<br>
And when this we rightly know<br>
Thro' the World we safely go.<br>
Joy & Woe are woven fine,<br>
A Clothing for the Soul divine;<br>
Under every grief & pine<br>
Runs a joy with silken twine.<br>
The Babe is more than swadling Bands;<br>
Throughout all these Human Lands<br>
Tools were made, & born were hands,<br>
Every Farmer Understands.<br>
Every Tear from Every Eye<br>
Becomes a Babe in Eternity.<br>
This is caught by Females bright<br>
And return'd to its own delight.<br>
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar<br>
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.<br>
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath<br>
Writes Revenge in realms of death.<br>
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,<br>
Does to Rags the Heavens tear.<br>
The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,<br>
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.<br>
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more<br>
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.<br>
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands<br>
Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:<br>
Or, if protected from on high,<br>
Does that whole Nation sell & buy.<br>
He who mocks the Infant's Faith<br>
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.<br>
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt<br>
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.<br>
He who respects the Infant's faith<br>
Triumph's over Hell & Death.<br>
The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons<br>
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.<br>
The Questioner, who sits so sly,<br>
Shall never know how to Reply.<br>
He who replies to words of Doubt<br>
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.<br>
The Strongest Poison ever known<br>
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.<br>
Nought can deform the Human Race<br>
Like the Armour's iron brace.<br>
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow<br>
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.<br>
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry<br>
Is to Doubt a fit Reply.<br>
The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile<br>
Make Lame Philosophy to smile.<br>
He who Doubts from what he sees<br>
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.<br>
If the Sun & Moon should doubt<br>
They'd immediately Go out.<br>
To be in a Passion you Good may do,<br>
But no Good if a Passion is in you.<br>
The Whore & Gambler, by the State<br>
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.<br>
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street<br>
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.<br>
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,<br>
Dance before dead England's Hearse.<br>
Every Night & every Morn<br>
Some to Misery are Born.<br>
Every Morn & every Night<br>
Some are Born to sweet Delight.<br>
Some ar Born to sweet Delight,<br>
Some are born to Endless Night.<br>
We are led to Believe a Lie<br>
When we see not Thro' the Eye<br>
Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night<br>
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.<br>
God Appears & God is Light<br>
To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,<br>
But does a Human Form Display<br>
To those who Dwell in Realms of day. <br>
<br>
<br>
								<h3>A Divine Image <br>
								<br>
								<h4>Cruelty has a human heart,<br>
								And Jealousy a human face;<br>
								Terror the human form divine,<br>
And Secresy the human dress.<br>
<br>
The human dress is forged iron,<br>
The human form a fiery forge,<br>
The human face a furnace sealed,<br>
The human heart its hungry gorge. <br>
<br>
<br>

								<h3>The Angel <br>
								<br>
								<h4>I dreamt a dream! What can it mean?<br>
								And that I was a maiden Queen<br>
								Guarded by an Angel mild:<br>
Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!<br>
<br>
And I wept both night and day,<br>
And he wiped my tears away;<br>
And I wept both day and night,<br>
And hid from him my heart's delight.<br>
<br>
So he took his wings, and fled;<br>
Then the morn blushed rosy red.<br>
I dried my tears, and armed my fears<br>
With ten-thousand shields and spears.<br>
<br>
Soon my Angel came again;<br>
I was armed, he came in vain;<br>
For the time of youth was fled,<br>
And grey hairs were on my head. <br>
<br>
<br>

								<h3>A Cradle Song <br>
								<br>
								<h4>Sweet dreams form a shade,<br>
								O'er my lovely infants head.<br>
								Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,<br>
By happy silent moony beams<br>
<br>
Sweet sleep with soft down.<br>
Weave thy brows an infant crown.<br>
Sweet sleep Angel mild,<br>
Hover o'er my happy child.<br>
<br>
Sweet smiles in the night,<br>
Hover over my delight.<br>
Sweet smiles Mothers smiles,<br>
All the livelong night beguiles.<br>
<br>
Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,<br>
Chase not slumber from thy eyes,<br>
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,<br>
All the dovelike moans beguiles.<br>
<br>
Sleep sleep happy child,<br>
All creation slept and smil'd.<br>
Sleep sleep, happy sleep.<br>
While o'er thee thy mother weep<br>
<br>
Sweet babe in thy face,<br>
Holy image I can trace.<br>
Sweet babe once like thee.<br>
Thy maker lay and wept for me<br>
<br>
Wept for me for thee for all,<br>
When he was an infant small.<br>
Thou his image ever see.<br>
Heavenly face that smiles on thee,<br>
<br>
Smiles on thee on me on all,<br>
Who became an infant small,<br>
Infant smiles are His own smiles,<br>
Heaven & earth to peace beguiles. <br>
